# TP3 - C# 

## Description
This project consists of 12 practical exercises in C# that cover fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, constructors, and encapsulation. The goal is to strengthen C# programming skills by solving real-world problems and applying theoretical concepts in practice.

## Features

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Class and Object Concepts**: Explanation and practical example.
- **Ticket Management System**: Create, modify, and display ticket information.
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation of getters and setters.
- **Constructors**: Simplifying object creation with predefined values.

### C# Application Development
- **Enrollment Management**: Suspending, reactivating, and displaying enrollment information.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Calculating area and volume using C# methods.
- **Class Testing**: Implementing a `Main` method for verification.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C#
- **Libraries**: `Math` (for mathematical calculations)
- **Concepts**: Classes, objects, methods, attributes, constructors, encapsulation
